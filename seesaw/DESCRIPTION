Description: 
    Seesaw is a spatial interpolation package that focuses on NOAA weather station
    data. It uses the GpGp package to interpolate weather data across the United States.
    The data can be visualized using ggplot2 and sf. The package uses the 2020 
    census United States shapefile to create a grid of points over the lower 48
    states.
