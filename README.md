# 4520Project
STSCI 4520 Final Project

The following code repository surrounds the creation of a spatial interpolation package in R. In particular, the project serves as a mechanism to interpolate NOAA climate data over the Continental United States. The package uses the most recent United States Census file to create a grid of points over the US at a specified resolution. It then uses Vecchia's Gaussian process approximation algorithm to quickly interpolate values over the grid. 

This project was jointly created by Robert Feldstein & Ava Glowney.
